    "\n",
    "### b. Clear Problem Statement\n",
    "Users often experience decision fatigue or find themselves consuming content that doesn't align with their current emotional state or time of day. Most platforms recommend content based solely on past history, ignoring the user's *immediate* mood. Anshika aims to bridge this gap by suggesting personalized activities and YouTube videos based on a real-time assessment of user mood (Focus, Relax, Bored, or Sad) and the current time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Real-world Relevance and Motivation\n",
    "In an era of information overload, mental well-being is closely tied to digital consumption. Suggesting a high-intensity action movie to someone feeling 'Sad' might be counterproductive, whereas an uplifting music video could improve their mood. Anshika motivates balanced living by adapting the digital environment to the user's psychological state."
